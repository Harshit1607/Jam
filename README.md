# MIRRORLESS - Landing Page Experience

This project is a modern, premium landing page designed for a luxury boutique hotel. It features a unique, immersive entry experience and a highly polished hero section that immediately captures the user's attention.

## The Concept: 3 Assigned Words

The entire design and interaction flow of this project was built around three core words: **Hotel**, **Photography**, and **Mirror**. Here is how each word was incorporated into the experience:

### 1. Hotel
The core subject of the project is the **Grand Emily Hotel**. We designed a premium, skeuomorphic-inspired and typography-driven hero section to convey luxury and exclusivity. The UI includes essential hotel booking elements such as:
- A sophisticated booking bar (Dates, Rooms, Adults/Children).
- Clean, high-contrast navigation for "Our Locations" and "Book Now".
- Elegant serif fonts (`Serif Sans 4`) paired with clean sans-serif (`system default`) to give it a high-end hospitality feel.

### 2. Photography
The concept of photography is deeply embedded in the user experience of the site. 
- **The Preloader**: Before the main site reveals itself, the user is greeted with a 3D preloader experience. Once the core assets are loaded, the main website UI "prints" down onto the screen mimicking the development and emergence of a **Polaroid photograph**. 
- **The Concept**: The hotel is framed as a place where "every room is a private studio," emphasizing the aesthetic and photogenic qualities of the stay. The framing of the hero section with a horizontal border line also mimics looking through a camera viewfinder. 

### 3. Mirror
The idea of the mirror in this project is not symbolic storytelling but visual interaction. The mirror concept is primarily expressed in two ways: first through the hero section typography, where the main logo incorporates a mirrored treatment within the letterforms, reinforcing the identity of the brand visually. Second, and more importantly, through the interactive section that follows the hero.

-The post-hero section is divided into two halves: left and right. These halves move in opposite vertical directions during scroll. As the user scrolls down, one section translates upward while the other translates downward.
-This opposing motion creates the perception of a reflective surface, similar to how an object and its reflection move in relation to each other. The effect is subtle and controlled to maintain the premium hotel aesthetic.

## Tech Stack
